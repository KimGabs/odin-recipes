    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Korean potato salad is an adaptation of America's most popular potato salad, but has its own identity when using Korean mayonnaise.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 medium russet potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>¼ cup minced carrot</li>
        <li>½ medium unpeeled cucumber, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup diced red onion</li>
        <li>2 hard-boiled eggs</li>
        <li>½ small red apple, cored and chopped</li>
        <li>1 pinch black pepper</li>
        <li>Korean mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large pot of salted cold water. Bring to a boil and cook until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add carrots during the last 3 minutes of cooking. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place cucumber slices in a strainer and sprinkle with salt, coating the slices. Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Thoroughly rinse cucumbers and transfer to a stack of paper towels or a dry kitchen towel. Give them a good squeeze until most of the moisture is removed. This is an important step if you don't want to end up with a runny dressing.</li>
        <li>Cut hard-boiled eggs in half, and set aside 1/2 of 1 yolk. Cut egg whites and remaining yolks into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes and carrots in a large bowl. Mash gently by pressing down with the back of a spoon until mostly mashed, but still a bit chunky. Mix in chopped egg, cucumber, red onion, apple, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Whisk mayonnaise, gochujang, sesame oil, and ginger together in a bowl; fold into the potato mixture.</li>
        <li>Grate reserved egg yolk over the potato salad, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.</li>
    </ol>
